# Artificial Intelligence Platform for Traffic Signals

Revolutionising transport networks utilising artificial intelligence. 

Our TrafficSignals.ai platform is for intelligent transport system integrators, who need advanced traffic signal detection and control, the TrafficSignals.ai platform is a technology framework that significantly reduces the time taken to deliver products and solutions. Unlike building or buying an off the shelf solution, the TrafficSignals.ai allows tight technical integration, full data gathering and control and the necessary regulatory documentation for rapid product and solution realisation.

# Common Library for Open Source

This library contains source code which is derived directly from or uses open source software. 

Note, the instruction for use below are for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, other platforms may vary.  

## Pre-requisites 

Please install the following libraries. Note, all are required, even if only some or one part of the libraries are used. 

```Bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade

sudo apt install gcc build-essential cmake pkg-config git

sudo apt install libboost-all-dev 
```

## Download 

To download the repository from source control, execute the following: 

```Bash
mkdir -p ~/src/TrafficSignals-ai
cd ~/src/TrafficSignals-ai
git clone https://github.com/TrafficSignals-ai/common-open.git
```


## JetsonGPIO Installation

The JetsonGPIO library requires additional installation steps prior to operating. Follow the instructions below. 

Build it, and install it.
```
cd ~/src/TrafficSignals-ai/common-open/JetsonGPIO/build
make all
sudo make install
```

### Setting User Permissions

In order to use the Jetson GPIO Library, the correct user permissions/groups must  
be set first. Or you have to run your program with root permission.    

Create a new gpio user group. Then add your user to the newly created group.  

```Bash
sudo groupadd -f -r gpio
sudo usermod -a -G gpio [your_user_name]
```

Install custom udev rules by copying the 99-gpio.rules file into the rules.d  
directory. The 99-gpio.rules file was copied from NVIDIA's official repository.  

```Bash
sudo cp ~/src/TrafficSignals-ai/common-open/JetsonGPIO/99-gpio.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
```

For the new rule to take place, you either need to reboot or reload the udev
rules by running:

```Bash
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
```

## Compile

To compile the repository from source control, execute the following: 

```Bash
cd ~/src/TrafficSignals-ai/common-open
./compile.sh    
```

## Source Documentation 

To automatically create source documentation from the comments in the source files execute the following steps from the home directory of the project:

```Bash
sudo apt install doxygen # if not already installed...
cd ~/src/trafficsignals-ai/common-open
doxygen
```
Files will now have been created in the ```/html``` and ```/latex``` directories. ```/html/index.html``` is the home page for the documentation.

Execute the following to bring up the index: 

```Bash
x-www-browser index.html
```

## Libraries Used

### Boost.Asio

Boost.Asio is a cross-platform C++ library for network and low-level I/O programming that provides developers with a consistent asynchronous model using a modern C++ approach. The source code can be found in the /BOOST directory and is derived from the examples provided. 

[Official Page](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_76_0/doc/html/boost_asio.html) - [Licence](BOOST/BOOST_LICENSE_1_0.txt) - [Licence FAQ](https://www.boost.org/users/license.html#FAQ) - [Documentation](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_76_0/doc/html/boost_asio/reference.html)

### RapidXml

RapidXml is an attempt to create the fastest XML parser possible, while retaining useability, portability and reasonable W3C compatibility. It is an in-situ parser written in modern C++, with parsing speed approaching that of strlen function executed on the same data.

This implementation uses the licence option 2, the "2. The MIT License" permitted under the [licence agreement options](http://rapidxml.sourceforge.net/license.txt) .

### JetsonGPIO
JetsonGPIO is an C++ port of the **NVIDIA's Jetson.GPIO Python library**(https://github.com/NVIDIA/jetson-gpio).    

Jetson TX1, TX2, AGX Xavier, and Nano development boards contain a 40 pin GPIO header, similar to the 40 pin header in the Raspberry Pi. These GPIOs can be controlled for digital input and output using this library. The library provides almost same APIs as the Jetson.GPIO Python library.
